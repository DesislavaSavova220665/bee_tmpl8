Here is a simple C++ game about collecting flowers with limited time. In the game, the player controls a character that can move around a 2D grid to collect flowers. The player needs to collect as many flowers as possible within a limited amount of time. The game ends when the time runs out.

You play with the Up, DOwn,Left and Right arrows on your keyboard!

It is simple without levels and only for the entertainng of collecting flowers!
 It is based on the game "B-A-B2" on itch.io: https://palmpixel.itch.io/bee2 , but simple and for beginners like me this was all i could do for now!

  I am planning to make more  big updates after the intake, because i have a time limit here and i am a slow learner!!!
   hope you enjoy the game and feel free to give me any critical opinion about the code.
