### !IMPORTANT!
It is simple without levels and only for the entertainng of collecting flowers!
 It is based on the game "B-A-B2" on itch.io: https://palmpixel.itch.io/bee2 , but simplified version made from the hands of a C++ beginner!

 I am planning to make more  big updates after the intake, because i have a time limit here and i am a slow learner!!!
I hope you enjoy the game and feel free to give me any critical opinion about the code.
